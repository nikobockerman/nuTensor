## nuTensor

Definitely for advanced users.

This is a fork of the now-discontinued [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix).
My focus will be on keeping it working on Firefox for now. I'll do my best to keep it working, but sadly no guarantees. Help will always be welcome!

Forked and refactored from [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix).

## Warnings

#### Regarding broken sites

nuTensor does not guarantee that sites will work fine: it is for advanced users who can figure how to un-break sites, because essentially nuTensor is a firewall which works in relaxed block-all/allow-exceptionally mode out of the box: it is not unexpected that sites will break.

**So this means do not file issues to report broken sites when the sites are broken because nuTensor does its job as expected.** I will close any such issue without further comment.

**Using nuTensor logger is key to un-break sites:** the logger will show you all that nuTensor does internally.
